Please see http://www.adwhirl.com/doc/android/AdWhirlAndroidSDKSetup.html for setup instructions, Changelog.txt for changes in this version and http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl for the latest news, releases and issue reports.

Quick Start:

Add the following mandatory permissions to AndroidManifest.xml

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

And the following optional permissions

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" /> 
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /> 

Create an AdWhirlLayout. Make sure that this code is called in the main thread.

	AdWhirlLayout adWhirlLayout = new AdWhirlLayout(this, "AdWhirl SDK Key");
	RelativeLayout.LayoutParams adWhirlLayoutParams = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(320, 52);
	layout.addView(adWhirlLayout, adWhirlLayoutParams);

You can choose whatever size you want for the layout. We suggest 320x52, as this is the largest ad unit size. If you choose to make the view smaller, ads will still display, but may cut off a few pixels and display a small scroll bar.

You can take a look at our sample Invoker activity here: http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/browse/android/src/com/adwhirl/Invoker.java?repo=sdk
