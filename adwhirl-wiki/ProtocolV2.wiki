<wiki:toc/>

= !AdWhirl Client/Server Protocol v2 =

This document describes the !AdWhirl client/server protocol v2. All communication is over HTTP, and all responses from the server are in JSON, so it is easy to implement a client for your platform of choice.

If you run your own !AdWhirl server instance, substitute `*`.adwhirl.com hostnames below with your hostname.

== Common Fields ==

Some fields that are used throughout the different requests.
  * appver: The client version as an integer
  * client: The client platform

  * appid: The !AdWhirl SDK Key for the application
  * nid: The unique identifier for an application's ad network
  * type: The type value of the particular network. See below
  * uuid: The device's uuid. The client hashes the value to address privacy concerns
