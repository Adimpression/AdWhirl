These are templates for new AdWhirl files. To use the test case template, link it like so:

sudo ln -s "<your adwhirl directory>/iphone/FileTemplates/AdWhirlTestCaseClass.pbfiletemplate" \
  "/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/File Templates/Cocoa Touch Class/"

Once you link it, you will see "AdWhirlTestCaseClass" in the New File dialog in Coca Touch Class. Make sure the test class file name ends with "Test.m"

Link Adwhirl class the same way for an empty class template with the standard Apache license.

If you are seeing __MyCompanyName__ in the generated file, make sure to set the company field for your personal card in Address Book.
